This website is aimed at people to create and maintain lists publicly about various things (like fav. movies, games, books, top animes, etc) which they can share on their social pages so strangers can know what that person likes. 

## How to run
Open any shell and navigate to the root folder.
Enter ``` npm start ```

## What's left
There's a lot left to implement in this project, design-wise and feature-wise. This is just a prototype.
There's need to
- create and maintain profiles of different user
- a button to create a share link
- provide a personal look to the website
